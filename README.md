# SMITE Memory Game

## This is a Smite themed memory game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The requirements for this project are to create a interactive front end website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript(optional libaries such as Jquery). This project is a simple memory game that features 16 cards in which you have to match two of the same pair. The site gives you clear instructions on how to play the game and restart the game once it is finished.

The aim of the game is to find and pair all of the cards(Gods).

## User Stories

- I am a 16 year old who is looking to play a simple game whilst waiting to load into an online match
- I am an avid SMITE fan and am looking to play a smite related game that isn't as intense as SMITE itself

## Home

SMITE is a online multiplayer moba that I am a huge fan of. When initially creating the wireframes I wanted to give the user a 'battleground' or 'colloseum' feeling as if they where preparing to battle. The SMITE logo is a very distinguishing logo and helped me theme the rest of the page.
The game has a very simple landing page with the Logo, Cards, Restart button and Game Rules.

## Design Ideas

I was able to obtain official SMITE images through [Title](https://smite.fandom.com/wiki). This was an amazing find as it gave me every bit of imgaery I needed.

Logo:

Card design:

I had options out of the following two, I chose to go for 1 because it looked very original on the page. 2 did look very nice, however it didn't quite match the theme of the logo:

I deployed my website using GitPages. To do this, the steps are as follows:

(I documented any changes through VS source control tab)

- Once you have made changes to your code, click the Source Control tab in the activity bar.

- Select the changes you wish to commit by clicking the + symbol next to the file name (you can commit seperate changes in one push to the respository)

- Once you have given a message to all of the committed changes you will see a 'Sync' option. Click that to push the code to your git repository.

# Future Features

In the future I would like the a function that allows you to select different mythoglogy. For e.g, I could choose from Greek, Asian or African mythology (based off the information in game).

I would also like to add God Lore, which you can select a god an find out more on them through a description.
